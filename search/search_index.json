Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given. You can contribute in many ways: Types of Contributions Report Bugs ~~~~~~~~~~~ Report bugs at https://github.com/lubianat/wbib/issues. If you are reporting a bug, please include: Your operating system name and version. Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting. Detailed steps to reproduce the bug. Fix Bugs ~~~~~~~~ Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with \"bug\" and \"help wanted\" is open to whoever wants to implement it. Implement Features ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with \"enhancement\" and \"help wanted\" is open to whoever wants to implement it. Write Documentation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Wikidata Bib could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official Wikidata Bib docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such. Submit Feedback ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/lubianat/wbib/issues. If you are proposing a feature: Explain in detail how it would work. Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement. Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :) Get Started! Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up wbib for local development. Fork the wbib repo on GitHub. Clone your fork locally:: $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/wbib.git Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development:: $ mkvirtualenv wbib $ cd wbib/ $ python setup.py develop Create a branch for local development:: $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature Now you can make your changes locally. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the tests, including testing other Python versions with tox:: $ flake8 wbib tests $ python setup.py test or pytest $ tox To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:: $ git add . $ git commit -m \"Your detailed description of your changes.\" $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature Submit a pull request through the GitHub website. Pull Request Guidelines Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines: The pull request should include tests. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.rst. The pull request should work for Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8, and for PyPy. Check https://travis-ci.com/lubianat/wbib/pull_requests and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions. Tips To run a subset of tests:: $ python -m unittest tests.test_wbib Deploying A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy. Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.rst). Then run:: $ bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch $ git push $ git push --tags Travis will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.","title":"Contribution guide"},{"location":"contributing/#types-of-contributions","text":"Report Bugs ~~~~~~~~~~~ Report bugs at https://github.com/lubianat/wbib/issues.
